/* 
  ! Operators
  * In JavaScript, we have different kinds of operators we use these operators along with variables and constants to create an expression. e.g a + b;
  * and with these expressions we can implement logic and algorithms.
  * 
  * So here are the different kinds of operators in JavaScript
    * 1. Arithmetic operators
    * 2. Assignment operators
    * 3. Camparison operators
    * 4. Logical operators
*/

/* 
  * 1. Arithmetic operators
  * What we have here is x + y is what we refer to as an expression in JavaScript.
  ! So an expression, is something that produces a value.
*/
let x = 10
let y = 3
// Operand Operator and then Operand
console.log(x + y)
console.log(x - y)
console.log(x * y)
console.log(x / y)
console.log(x % y)
console.log(x ** y)

/* 
  * Two more operators are
  * 1. Increment Operators (++)
    * 
  * 2. Decrement Operators
*/

// * 1. Increment Operators (++)
// console.log(++x)
console.log(x++) //x = x + 1
console.log(x)
// * 2. Decrement Operators
console.log(--x)
console.log(x--)
console.log(x)

// * 2. Assignment operators

// x = x + 1
// console.log(z)

console.log(x+=5)

// ! All the arithmetic have the same combination with assignment operators.
