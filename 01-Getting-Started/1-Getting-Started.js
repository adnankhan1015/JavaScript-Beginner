  ? Where does JavaScript code runs?
  * JavaScript was originally designed to run only in browsers. So every browser have what we call a JavaScript Engine that can execute JavaScript JavaScript Code.
  * JavaScript Engine in Chrome is V8 and in Firefox is Spider Monkey.
  * In 2009, a very clever engineer named *Ryan Dahl* took the open source JavaScript engine in Google Chrome, and embedded it inside a C++ Program. 
  * He called that program NODE.
  * So, Node is a C++ Program that includes Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
  * Now, with this we can run JavaScript Code outside of the browser.
  * So we can pass our Js code to node for execution and this means with JavaScript we can build the backend for our web and mobile applications.
  * Browser and Node Provides a runtime environment for our JavaScript Code.
