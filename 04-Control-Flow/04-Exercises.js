/* 
  ! 1. FizzBuzz Algorithm
  * We have a function called "fizzbuzz" we give it an "input" and it returns a string.
  * So, if the number that we are passing is divisible by 3 we get "fizz"
  * if the number that we pass is divisible by 5 we get "buzz"
  * if the number that we pass is divisible by 3 and 5 we get "fizzbuzz"
  * If the number that we pass is not divisible by 3 and 5 we get same input
  * If we don't pass a number like we pass a string e.g 'ff' we get a Not a Number, the is true for boolean or anything that is not a number
*/

/* 
  ! 2. maximum number
  * Write a function that takes two numbers and returns a the maximum of the two?
*/

/* 
  ! 3. Show Number
  * Write a function that takes a limit(as s number). 
  * The functions shows, the even and odd numbers from 0 to the limit(that user pass into the function)
*/

/* 
  ! 4. Count Trhty
  * Create a function called countTruthy, which takes an array and returns a number of truthy elements in this array.
*/


/*
  ! 5. String Properties
  * Create a function called showProperties.
    * We pass an object here and this function should display all the properties of this object that are of the type string.
